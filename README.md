👋 I'm [Thomas Witt](https://github.com/thomaswitt) — tech entrepreneur & angel investor. After 25 years scaling B2B SaaS from zero to exit, I’m back in founder mode, quietly building a category-redefining AI B2B platform while still backing bold deep-tech founders through [Expedite Ventures](https://www.expedite.ventures/).

**[We are hiring Employee #2](https://vendis.ai/jobs/): AI B2B SaaS Startup (Stack: Rails, LLM, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Hotwire/minimal JS, ViewComponents), zero legacy code, tiny senior team, US Delaware Corp w/ equity upside - [apply via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4271296722/) or drop me a DM.**

Coding since age 8 and connected to the internet since ’90, I co-founded my first software company straight out of high school (’97) and, as CTO, built award-winning platforms that served tens of thousands of customers. Ruby on Rails since ’09, AWS since ’10, knee-deep in AI for the past five years.

[Expedite Ventures](https://www.expedite.ventures/) is a crew of CTOs/CPOs investing and mentoring at pre-seed, leveraging our network and decades of collective expertise. Got something ambitious? Read our [playbook](https://www.expedite.ventures/playbook).

When the screens dim you’ll find me making music, flying, sailing, behind a lens, or in the kitchen. ✈️ ⛵ 🎶 📷 🍳
