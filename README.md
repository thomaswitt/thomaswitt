👋 I'm Thomas Witt — tech entrepreneur & angel investor. After 25 years scaling B2B SaaS from zero to exit, I’m back in founder mode, building [Vendis.ai](https://vendis.ai), a category-redefining AI-native CRM while still backing deep-tech founders through [Expedite Ventures](https://www.expedite.ventures/).

Coding since age 8 and connected to the internet since ’90, I co-founded my first software company straight out of high school (’97) and, as CTO, built award-winning platforms that served tens of thousands of customers. Ruby on Rails since ’09, AWS since ’10, knee-deep in AI for the past five years.

Expedite Ventures is a crew of CTOs/CPOs investing and mentoring at pre-seed, leveraging our network and decades of collective expertise. Got something ambitious? Read our [playbook](https://www.expedite.ventures/playbook).

As a side project, I run [Airfield Directory](https://airfield.directory), a free, non-commercial, and open (CC BY-SA) database for airport information and reports for general aviation pilots worldwide.

When the screens dim you’ll find me making music, flying, sailing, behind a lens, or in the kitchen. ✈️ ⛵ 🎶 📷 🍳
